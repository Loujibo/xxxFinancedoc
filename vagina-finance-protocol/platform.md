* Epoch duration: 6 hours
* Any interaction with the [TAMPON](https://Hauntedfinance.app/TAMPON) (staking/unstaking $VAMPIRE or withdrawing $FRANKENSTEIN rewards) will **lock your staked $VAMPIRE for 6 epochs and $FRANKENSTEIN** **rewards for 3 epochs.**&#x20;
*   Distribution of $FRANKENSTEIN during Expansion

    **80%** as Reward for Boardroom $VAMPIRE Stakers\
    **15%** goes to Community fund

    **5%** goes to DEV fund
* Epoch Expansion: The current expansion cap is based on the currently circulating $FRANKENSTEIN supply (see below for details). If there are bonds to be redeemed, 65% of minted $FRANKENSTEIN goes to the treasury until its sufficiently stocked to satisfy future bond redemption

| $FRANKENSTEIN Circulating Supply | Max $FRANKENSTEIN Minted |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Up to 1.5M                | 3% expansion      |
| Up to 5M                  | 2.5% expansion    |
| Up to 10M                 | 2% expansion      |
| Up to 20M                 | 1.5% expansion    |

### [TAMPON](https://Hauntedfinance.app/TAMPON) UI Information

Next **Epoch** indicates a countdown timer to the next epoch. (Each epoch duration lasts for 6 hours)                                                                                                              &#x20;

**APR** refers to the simple returns in USD value relative to the amount of $VAMPIRE staked (USD value).\
_Note: **** APR fluctuates from time to time and is dependent on certain factors such as:_

* Price of $FRANKENSTEIN
* Price of $VAMPIRE
* Amount of $VAMPIRE staked in Hatchery (Locked Value)

### [TAMPON](https://Hauntedfinance.app/TAMPON) Debt Phase

A debt phase takes place during expansion epochs that start after a contraction period where there are still $SKULL to be redeemed.

65% of expansion during a debt phase is allocated to the treasury fund to prepare for subsequent $SKULL redemption down the road. This amount is always reserved, regardless of whether $SKULL holders are redeeming bonds or not.

Once enough $FRANKENSTEIN is sufficiently stocked in the treasury to satisfy the redemption of all circulating $SKULL , expansion rates will resume to normal.

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Haunted Finance protocol tokens, our LP [PANTIES](https://Hauntedfinance.app/PANTIES) have been seeded with $VAMPIREs to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total $VAMPIRE rewards are distributed from each [PANTIES](https://Hauntedfinance.app/PANTIES) as follows:

* $FRANKENSTEIN-FTM LP: 10,000 $VAMPIRE
* $VAMPIRE-FTM LP: 20,000 $VAMPIRE

$SKULL (bond tokens) are available for purchase when $FRANKENSTEIN falls below the 1 FTM peg. If $FRANKENSTEIN's TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01, neither $SKULL nor $FRANKENSTEIN will be issued.

Check out the Bonds Mechanism section for a detailed breakdown of how bonds work.
