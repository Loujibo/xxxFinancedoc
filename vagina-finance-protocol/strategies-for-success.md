### **Genesis Pool Strategy**

When the protocol launches, the genesis pools will be live for **2** days. By depositing wFTM, USDT, DAI, you will continuously receive $FRANKENSTEIN tokens as rewards! We strongly encourage all participants to partake in the genesis pools as early as possible, as **this is a risk free way to earn $FRANKENSTEIN tokens**.

### [PANTIES](https://Hauntedfinance.app/PANTIES) **LP Strategy**

The LP pools will open 3 days after the genesis pools open. Take your $FRANKENSTEIN rewards from the genesis pools (and/or [buy some on SpookySwap](broken-reference)) and pair it with FTM to receive $FRANKENSTEIN-FTM LP tokens. (Refer to the [Provide Liquidity](broken-reference) section for instructions on how to do this). You can then stake those LP tokens in our [PANTIES](https://Hauntedfinance.app/PANTIES) to earn $VAMPIRE tokens as rewards.\

Furthermore, you can withdraw your $VAMPIRE token rewards and pair it with FTM to receive $VAMPIRE-FTM LP tokens (Refer to the [Provide Liquidity](broken-reference) section for instructions on how to do this). Stake those LP tokens in our [PANTIES](https://Hauntedfinance.app/PANTIES) to earn even more $VAMPIRE. Talk about compounding gains!
