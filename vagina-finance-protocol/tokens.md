# üë©üè≠ Tokens

## $LABIA

![](../.gitbook/assets/crypto\_main\_cash.png)



Contract: 0x52530B1aE82792B561bfeC299e18e306ac3C1e33

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

The $LABIA token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain $LABIA's peg to 1 Fantom (FTM) token in the long run. \
\


{% hint style="info" %}
Note that $LABIA **actively pegs via the algorithm**, it **does not mean** it will be valued at 1 FTM all times as it is not collaterized . $LABIA is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.
{% endhint %}

## $LSHARE

Contract: 0xD6337601D2784550e8d0Adc2FFBA49D7B5a96c60



$LSHAREs are one of the ways to measure the value of the Vagina Finance Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to consistently maintain $LABIA close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints $LABIA and distributes it proportionally to all $LSHARE holders who have staked their tokens in the [TAMPON](https://vaginafinance.app/TAMPON).

$LSHARE has a **maximum total supply of 30,000** tokens distributed as follows:

1. _Treasury/DAO Allocation: 4,500_ $LSHAREs vested linearly over _210 days_
2. _Team Allocation: 1,500_ $LSHAREs vested linearly over _210 days_
3. _Rewards: 24,000 $_LSHAREs are allocated for incentivizing liquidity providers in two farming pools for _210 days_

## $LBOND - $LABIA Bonds

![](../.gitbook/assets/crypto\_main\_bond.png)

Contract: 0xc067e4268DEEB101EAa74D58d76D04445C11e42b

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

The main purpose of $LABIA Bonds ($LBOND) is to help incentivize changes in $LABIA supply during an epoch contraction period. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of $LABIA falls below 1 FTM,  $LBONDs are issued and can be bought with $LABIA at the current price. Exchanging $LABIA for $LBOND burns $LABIA tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to peg. These $LBOND can be redeemed for $LABIA when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for $LABIA when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward the 1 $LABIA to 1 FTM.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike early algorithmic protocols, $LBONDs do not have expiration dates.
{% endhint %}

All $LBOND holders will be able to redeem their $LBOND for $LABIA tokens as long as the treasury has a positive $LABIA balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.
