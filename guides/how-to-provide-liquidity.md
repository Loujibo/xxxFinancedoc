# ðŸ”µ How to Provide Liquidity

In order to provide Liquidity, we first have to purchase either $FRANKENSTEIN or $VAMPIRE (have a look at our "How to buy $FRANKENSTEIN section if you need help in doing so), depending on which you want to provide liquidity for.

Providing liquidity is possible on [Spookyswap](https://spookyswap.finance/swap). Head over to the Liquidity tab on the left side of your screen. Connect your wallet (Make sure your Metamask is on the FTM Opera Network). Now you have to choose Ingredient A and B. Ingredient A will be FTM and ingredient B will either be $FRANKENSTEIN or $VAMPIRE. Note: Ingredients A and B must be equal in value (SpookySwap will automatically calculate this for you)

If $FRANKENSTEIN or $VAMPIRE do not show up, please copy/paste the address shown below manually.

**$FRANKENSTEIN**: 0xcDC6a39Ec85dE2248641C32b38A0836425980ce9

**$VAMPIRE**: 0x3e3190C6BAb74842E54e52D28B4F595576AaC249

Click on supply and accept the transaction in your wallet.

Now that you have provided LP, you can head over to [Hauntedfinance](https://hauntedfinance.app) and farm your LP's.
