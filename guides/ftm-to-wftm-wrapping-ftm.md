# 🟡 FTM to wFTM (Wrapping FTM)

You will need both FTM and wFTM (wrapped FTM) to interact with our protocol. For example FTM is required to pay for network fees on Fantom, while wFTM is needed to participate in our genesis pools (which earns you free $FRANKENSTEIN!).\
\
Fortunately, obtaining wFTM is easy. Just exchange your FTM for wFTM (and vice versa) on [Spookyswap](https://spookyswap.finance/swap)
