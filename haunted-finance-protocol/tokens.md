# Tokens

## $FRANKENSTEIN

Contract: 0x52530B1aE82792B561bfeC299e18e306ac3C1e33

The $FRANKENSTEIN token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain $FRANKENSTEIN's peg to 1 Fantom (FTM) token in the long run.\

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that $FRANKENSTEIN **actively pegs via the algorithm**, it **does not mean** it will be valued at 1 FTM all times as it is not collaterized . $FRANKENSTEIN is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.

## $VAMPIRE

$VAMPIREs are one of the ways to measure the value of the Haunted Finance Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to consistently maintain $FRANKENSTEIN close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints $FRANKENSTEIN and distributes it proportionally to all $VAMPIRE holders who have staked their tokens in the [TAMPON](https://hauntedfinance.app/TAMPON).

$VAMPIRE has a **maximum total supply of 30,000** tokens distributed as follows:

1. _Treasury/DAO Allocation: 4,500_ $VAMPIREs vested linearly over _210 days_
2. _Team Allocation: 1,500_ $VAMPIREs vested linearly over _210 days_
3. \_Rewards: 24,000 $\_VAMPIREs are allocated for incentivizing liquidity providers in two farming pools for _210 days_

## $SKULL - $FRANKENSTEIN Bonds

![](../.gitbook/assets/crypto\_main\_bond.png)

Contract: 0xc067e4268DEEB101EAa74D58d76D04445C11e42b

The main purpose of $FRANKENSTEIN Bonds ($SKULL) is to help incentivize changes in $FRANKENSTEIN supply during an epoch contraction period. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of $FRANKENSTEIN falls below 1 FTM, $SKULLs are issued and can be bought with $FRANKENSTEIN at the current price. Exchanging $FRANKENSTEIN for $SKULL burns $FRANKENSTEIN tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to peg. These $SKULL can be redeemed for $FRANKENSTEIN when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for $FRANKENSTEIN when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward the 1 $FRANKENSTEIN to 1 FTM.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike early algorithmic protocols, $SKULLs do not have expiration dates.
{% endhint %}

All $SKULL holders will be able to redeem their $SKULL for $FRANKENSTEIN tokens as long as the treasury has a positive $FRANKENSTEIN balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.
