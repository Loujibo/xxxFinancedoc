## $PINK

![](<../.gitbook/assets/maintoken (3)>)



Contract: 0xcDC6a39Ec85dE2248641C32b38A0836425980ce9

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

The $PINK token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain $PINK's peg to 1 Fantom (FTM) token in the long run. \
\


{% hint style="info" %}
Note that $PINK **actively pegs via the algorithm**, it **does not mean** it will be valued at 1 FTM all times as it is not collaterized . $PINK is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.

## $WHITE

$WHITEs are one of the ways to measure the value of the Breaking Finance Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to consistently maintain $PINK close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints $PINK and distributes it proportionally to all $WHITE holders who have staked their tokens in the **Bathtub** (boardroom).

$WHITE has a **maximum total supply of 60,000** tokens distributed as follows:

1. _Treasury/DAO Allocation: 5000_ $WHITEs vested linearly over _210 days_
2. _Team Allocation: 5000_ $WHITEs vested linearly over _210 days_
3. _Rewards: 50000 $WHITE_s are allocated for incentivizing liquidity providers in two farming pools for _210 days_

## $BLACK - $PINK Bonds

Contract: 0x876C2eFc89c5929F9147344d920E7388161BbdaC

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

The main purpose of $PINK Bonds ($BLACK) is to help incentivize changes in $PINK supply during an epoch contraction period. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of $PINK falls below 1 FTM,  $BLACKs are issued and can be bought with $PINK at the current price. Exchanging $PINK for $BLACK burns $PINK tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to peg. These $BLACK can be redeemed for $PINK when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for $PINK when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward the 1 $PINK to 1 FTM.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike early algorithmic protocols, $BLACKs do not have expiration dates.
{% endhint %}

All $BLACK holders will be able to redeem their $BLACK for $PINK tokens as long as the treasury has a positive $PINK balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.
