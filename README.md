Haunted Finance builds upon the great work of **tomb.finance**, which created the first algorithmic token pegged to $FTM on the Fantom Opera network. With the promise of lucrative yields, numerous subsequent copy-cat forks have launched, many of which turning out to be low-quality, poorly-managed, and downright dangerous to participate in (i.e. rug-pulls; awful founder token allocation, etc.)

As your fellow degen traders, we became increasingly frustrated with the lack of subsequent high-quality projects in this niche that could promise us those high yields that we all crave.

As full-stack blockchain engineers, we decided to launch our own protocol, building upon the progress made at tomb.finance while adding some enhancements that will not only improve yield generating opportunities but also promote fair and safe gameplay.

## [Vision](./#vision)

Haunted Finance is only the first phase in building out our gaming ecosystem. As our algorithms are continuously refined, we will launch additional protocols, including but not limited to a Play-to-Earn fighting game. All of our protocols will be interconnected within a unified ecosystem with a highly functional free-market economy, and all of our game protocols will provide tremendous yield generating opportunities.
